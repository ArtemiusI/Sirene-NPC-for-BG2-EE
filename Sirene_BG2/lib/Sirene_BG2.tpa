SAY NAME1 ~Purging Touch~
SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~Purging Touch

The most trusted and worthy of Ilmater's followers are granted a powerful healing touch. Once per day, Sirene may heal one creature other than herself by half their total hit points and removing the effects of all poisons and diseases as well as the effects of blindness, deafness, fear, sleep, feeblemind, unconsciousness, and intoxication, as well as berserk and confused states of mind. In addition, the recipient is protected against spells and other attacks that cause these effects for 1 turn.~

COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/spells/C0sblind.spl~ ~override~
SAY NAME1 ~Racial Power: Blinding Gaze~
SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~Blinding Gaze

Sirene's racial powers allow her to blind others upon making eye contact. The target must make a saving throw vs. spells at -3 or become blinded for one turn. Additionally, targets have a 20% chance to go berserk for two rounds (no save).~

COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/spells/C0sburn.spl~ ~override~
SAY NAME1 ~Racial Power: Burning Hands~
SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~Burning Hands

Tieflings with infernal heritage have the innate power to cast the Burning Hands spell.

When Sirene casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from her fingertips. Sirene's hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: her thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of Sirene. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. Spell receive half damage.~

COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/spells/C0sblur.spl~ ~override~
SAY NAME1 ~Racial Power: Blur~
SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~Blur

Tieflings with infernal heritage have the innate power to cast the Blur spell.

When a Blur spell is cast, Sirene causes the outline of her form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against her to be made with a -3 penalty. Sirene also gains a +1 bonus to all of her Saving Throws. The effects of this ability last for 4 rounds + 2 rounds per level.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: 10 ft.
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to take on the injuries of another creature, healing 3 hit points per level of the caster and dealing the same amount to <PRO_HIMHER>self as non-lethal damage.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: Touch
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None

This spell doubles the hit points of the spell recipient for the spell duration. Any damage suffered is taken first from these phantom hit points until they are all exhausted; damage is only then taken from the real hit points of the affected being. The spell also protects the vitality of the spell recipient so that all system shock rolls and checks of any sort against contracting diseases automatically succeed, and all other saving throws receive a +2 bonus. In addition, no being protected by endurance of Ilmater can be knocked over, trampled, ridden down, or overthrown; all protected beings can stand firm against all charges.

Endurance of Ilmater may only affect the same target once every 8 hours - repeated castings will have no effect until that amount of time has passed.~

(Evocation)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Range: 10 ft.
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: 4 rounds
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a beam of smoky gray radiance that streaks unerringly from the priest to a single chosen target who must be within view and range of the caster as casting begins. The target creature must make a saving throw vs. spell at a -5 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the target is overwhelmed by pain for one round (slowing its movement by half, adding 3 to all casting times, and forcing it to make all attack rolls at a -2 penalty) and suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage to its nervous system; it is then free of the spell.

If the saving throw is failed, the target creature suffers 4d6 points of non-lethal damage and is stunned and writhing helplessly in pain for the remainder of the current round and the following round. It can make no deliberate attacks, and its awareness of its surroundings is blotted out.

At the beginning of the second round after it was affected, the target being is allowed another saving throw vs. spell, this time at a -4 penalty. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, it suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage but is then free of the spell. If it fails, 3d6 points of non-lethal damage are inflicted, and the victim continues to be stunned and to writhe helplessly.

At the beginning of the third round after it was affected, the target is allowed a third saving throw vs. spell at a -3 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the victim suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage and is then freed from the spell. If the saving throw is failed, 2d6 points of non-lethal damage are inflicted, and the victim continues to be stunned and to writhe helplessly until the end of the round, when the spell ends.~

REPLACE ~99999~ ~Sirene walked away from the events of the Throne of Blood a changed person. Though she knew she would come to miss <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> companionship, she knew that with the power and confidence she had developed at her beloved friend's side, she would be able to move on and forge her own destiny with her hands. Sirene learned from <CHARNAME>'s journey that one's heritage did not control them, and discovered in herself the determination to follow her own righteous path - whether the world chose to accept her or not. She knew that despite her forsaking of her duty to Ilmater, her heroic deeds would redeem her to the Holy Warriors of Suffering... but despite that, she decided not to rejoin her order, instead choosing to become a wanderer, seeking and eliminating evil wherever she could. Though few knew of her as the heroine she was, and her name would rarely grace the bardic tales of tavern halls, it mattered not to her - so long as she succeeded in her duty, it mattered not whether she was recognized for it. Sirene eventually became lost to history, and the few who knew her name believed she had fallen in battle - though tales of evil across the Realms falling by a nameless vigilante's hand persisted for many years.~

This blade was once the possession of the tiefling slaver Asador, a vicious spellsword who terrorized the Coast Way road. Brimstone was created through infernal magic and cold iron, and in the tiefling's hands it was a vicious weapon. Asador was eventually slain by Sirene, tiefling paladin of Ilmater, whose fiendish blood allowed her to wield the blade. It has accompanied her through many battles since.

SAY DESC ~The rubies in this iron ring possess an inner flame and keep it warm to the touch. Though little is known of its past, it belonged to Sirene's mother, Lena, the daughter of a noble family rumored to have devilish ancestry. When Lena fled from the De'Bryll manor and married the ranger Edric Thornhaven, this ring was used during their wedding ceremony. When Sirene's parents lost their lives in a fire started by fearful townsfolk, this ring was discovered by Edric's sister and carried by her until she passed it on to Sirene.

Aside from its sentimental value, the ring bears some protective enchantments to make it of practical use, although the same enchantments make it worthless to anyone not of Sirene's bloodline.

Though this is the first time you have heard of the story, the book has clearly condensed and simplified parts of a much greater work.

SAY DESC ~This sinister weapon is coated with blood that seems impossible to clean off, though from whose the blood comes from is a question best left unanswered. Its horrifying appearance reflects its equally horrifying design, being a weapon which draws its strength from the pain of both the wielder and the unfortunate victim. The risk of the weapon is that it makes the wielder more powerful the closer <PRO_HESHE> is to death. While the double-edged nature of this weapon makes it a hard bargain for the typical warrior, it is heavily favoured by followers of masochistic and sadistic deities such as Loviatar and Talona.

Special: The book is consumed upon use
Usage: Place into quick item slot

-----

Favor of Ilmater
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: 10 ft.
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: Instant
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the priest to take on the injuries of another creature, healing 3 hit points per level of the caster and dealing the same amount to <PRO_HIMHER>self as non-lethal damage.

-----

Endurance of Ilmater
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: Touch
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None

This spell doubles the hit points of the spell recipient for the spell duration. Any damage suffered is taken first from these phantom hit points until they are all exhausted; damage is only then taken from the real hit points of the affected being. The spell also protects the vitality of the spell recipient so that all system shock rolls and checks of any sort against contracting diseases automatically succeed, and all other saving throws receive a +2 bonus. In addition, no being protected by endurance of Ilmater can be knocked over, trampled, ridden down, or overthrown; all protected beings can stand firm against all charges.

-----

Blast of Pain
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Range: 10 ft.
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Duration: 4 rounds
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a beam of smoky gray radiance that streaks unerringly from the priest to a single chosen target who must be within view and range of the caster as casting begins. The target creature must make a saving throw vs. spell at a -5 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the target is overwhelmed by pain for one round (slowing its movement by half, adding 3 to all casting times, and forcing it to make all attack rolls at a -2 penalty) and suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage to its nervous system; it is then free of the spell.

If the saving throw is failed, the target creature suffers 4d6 points of non-lethal damage and is stunned and writhing helplessly in pain for the remainder of the current round and the following round. It can make no deliberate attacks, and its awareness of its surroundings is blotted out.

At the beginning of the second round after it was affected, the target being is allowed another saving throw vs. spell, this time at a -4 penalty. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, it suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage but is then free of the spell. If it fails, 3d6 points of non-lethal damage are inflicted, and the victim continues to be stunned and to writhe helplessly.

At the beginning of the third round after it was affected, the target is allowed a third saving throw vs. spell at a -3 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the victim suffers 1d4+1 points of non-lethal damage and is then freed from the spell. If the saving throw is failed, 2d6 points of non-lethal damage are inflicted, and the victim continues to be stunned and to writhe helplessly until the end of the round, when the spell ends.

One of the mercenaries drank too much again and vomited all over my favorite robes. The pig! He has been punished with permanent lobotomy via a Feeblemind spell and left on the wayside to rot. Bah! I shall have to wear the one I brought from the Hosttower. That one, at least, is enchanted to remove stains."

"Kythorn 4
A man in rags passed by our regular raiding path today. We allowed him to pass. It was clear that he had nothing of value."

"Kythorn 5
Interesting. The man from yesterday has returned, and visited the ruined chapel in the nearby village. That place has been abandoned since the recent Bhaalspawn wars. What could he be doing?"

"Kythorn 7
There is an altar within the chapel, but some enchantment prevents anyone from entering the grounds. Blast! I must know what has been hidden in those ruins. Perhaps it is an artifact powerful enough to help me reclaim my position at the Hosttower."

"Kythorn 9
Two days spent attempting to break the glyphs surrounding those ruins with no luck. This is pointless. I shall have to wait and observe from the shadows. Someone will come for it... eventually."~
