 Sirene NPC Mod for BG:EE by Artemius_I
---------------------------------------

-----------------------
 Introduction & Details
-----------------------

This mod adds a new joinable NPC to the game: Sirene, a tiefling paladin of Ilmater. She has a custom kit: Martyr.

She can be found within the High Hall of the Radiant Heart, in the corridor past the entrance. She will only join a non-evil PC.

Her level is dependent on the PC's upon joining.

	STR: 16
	DEX: 17
	CON: 16
	INT: 10
	WIS: 14
	CHA: 17
	Total: 90

As a tiefling, she also has 10% fire and cold resistance.

She has both a friendship path and a romance, which can be initiated by a PC with 12 or above charisma and of either gender. PCs who knew her from BG1 can bring up their past for a few extra talks.

If your reputation drops below 9, she will stop her friendship and romance talks and warn you. If it drops below 5, she will leave permanently.

She is compatible with all NPCs except Dorn and Hexxat, who she will come to conflict with quickly and force you to choose between them.

-----------------------
 Martyr Kit
-----------------------

MARTYR: Martyrs are worshippers of Ilmater, the good god of suffering, endurance and martyrdom. Paladins of Ilmater's order are compassionate and train themselves to become protectors of their allies and to alleviate the suffering of others.

ADVANTAGES:

- Hit Die: d12
- May use Lay on Hands three times per day.
- May use the Sacrifice ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

SACRIFICE: The martyr heals the target for 1d6+1 per level hit points and deals 1d6+1 per level nonlethal damage to <PRO_HIMHER>self.

- May use the Martyrdom ability once per day starting at level 5. Gains an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

MARTYRDOM: The target gains a +4 bonus to armor class and 50% resistance to physical damage for 5 rounds while the martyr loses the same amount.

- 12th level: Gains 10% resistance to physical damage. An additional 5% is gained at levels 16 and 20.
- 15th level: May use the Ilmater's Grace ability once per day.

ILMATER'S GRACE: The martyr regenerates for 3 hit points per second for 1 turn.

DISADVANTAGES:

- -1 penalty to THAC0 every 5 levels (starting at level 1).
- May not cast Protection from Evil.
- May not Turn Undead.
- May not use ranged weapons.

-----------------------
 Friendship & Romance
-----------------------

Sirene can be befriended by a PC of any alignment, race or statistics though she will not join evil protagonists. A PC with 12 or more Charisma of either gender and any race or class can start a romance with her. Bear in mind that Sirene will not 'come on' to you immediately as vanilla romances do, and you actually have to show interest at some point during her friendship talks for the romance to take over. If she knew the PC from Baldur's Gate 1, the romance can start from their very first talk, while those who just met her will have to talk to her a few times. Show her you're interested, whether by rehashing a former relationship, flirting with her during her talks, or... buying her something nice?

-----------------------
 Crossmod
-----------------------

Sirene comes with crossmod content, which includes banters with the following mod NPCs: Fade, Foundling, Yvette (Lava Del'Vortel) and Pai'Na (myself)

Sirene also reacts to the following quest mods: Innershade, Tales of the Deep Gardens, I Shall Never Forget (Lava Del'Vortel)

Sirene also reacts to the following NPCS for the Romantic Encounters (multiple authors) mod (for technical reasons, this component may be installed separately):

- Weathermistress Ada
- Anishai
- Aran Linvail
- Bjornin
- Chanelle
- Desharik
- Eldoth
- Garren Windspear
- Hendak
- Ilona
- Jarlaxle
- Lais
- Laran
- Mekrath
- Rebecca
- Renal Bloodscalp
- Ribald Barterman
- Saemon Havarian
- Sheri D'Avignon
- Talak
- Isabelle
- Anne (will break romance)
- Cernd
- Captain Cernick

The reactions are harmless and will not break the romance (except for Anne)

-----------------------
 Installation
-----------------------

Unzip the files into your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition folder (usually C:/Program Files/Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition/Data/00783) and run Setup-Sirene_BG2.exe

 FAQs - Non-spoilers
-----------------------

Q: I had Sirene in my party in BG1 and acknowledged it to her. What changes?
A: You get one more dialogue in which you can set your previous relationship, and she gets a few more banters with NPCs from BG1, as well as one with Keldorn.

Q: Does Sirene have any personal quests?
A: Technically no quests, but there are encounters.

Q: Where are the encounters?
A: The first is a waylay that occurs when leaving Athkatla via the City Gates. The second is near-impossible to miss so long as you go to any Athkatlan district in Chapter 6 (except the Graveyard). There is also one in ToB - which she will begin via dialogue upon reaching the North Forest.

Q: Romance conflicts?
A: Not directly. However, Sirene will eventually ask you if you're interested in anyone. Choosing anyone except Sirene herself will terminate the romance.

Q: Can the Brimstone +1 be upgraded?
A: Yes, at Cromwell's. Requires a demon heart and 5,000 gold.

Q: Are there any new items?
A: There are over a dozen usable items included with this mod. Two can be upgraded and three are Sirene-exclusive.

Q: New areas?
A: Three in SoA, one in ToB. Each one has a specific encounter you can deal with, but only the first is mandatory.

Q: New spells?
A: Several. Some are mutually exclusive, owing to a certain choice Sirene must make.

Q: Does Sirene have conflicts with any other party members?
A: Sirene will not, under any circumstances, be in a party with Dorn or Hexxat.

Q: Which party members are good ideas to take with Sirene?
A: Sirene is written to fit in well with good-aligned parties, but she has plenty of dialogue with most party members. She has at least four banters with Keldorn, Anomen, Mazzy, Imoen, Jaheira, Valygar, Viconia and Yoshimo, so any of the above are good choices. She has the least to say with Jan and Korgan. Additionally, keeping Sirene and Valygar in the party for long enough may result in a tiny bonus...

 FAQs - Spoilers
-----------------------

Q: I'm romancing Sirene, and she's not talking to me. Help!
A: A few of Sirene's lovetalks require certain conditions to trigger:
	LT4: Triggers when PC is wounded (less than 75% hit points)
	LT10: Triggers when party is in a city
	LT11: Triggers when party is in Umar Hills
	LT14: Triggers when party rests at an inn

Q: Are there any lasting consequences for the Ilmatari encounter?
A: Depending on how you resolve the situation a certain number of points add to or subtract from a hidden 'faith' counter, which can potentially affect the conclusion of her final encounter. The amount of points gained or lost are as follows:
	- Sirene executes Revered Brother Daeron: -1 faith point
	- Party kills all Ilmatari (requires 17+ CHA, -2 reputation penalty): -4 faith points
	- Convince Sirene to let them go (requires 15+ CHA): -2 faith points
	- Convince Ilmatari to turn themselves in (requires 15+ WIS or CHA): +3 faith points
	
	There is also a following dialogue, in which the following dialogue options will affect her faith:
		"Perhaps Ilmater pitied him." = +1 faith point
		"You can't doubt your god, Sirene." = +2 faith points
		"Gods act in strange ways..." = +1 faith point
		"Maybe you're right." = -1 faith point
		"You don't need Ilmater..." = -2 faith points
		"Think on it..." = no change
	
Q: What does the 'faith' counter affect?
A: Depending on whether Sirene's faith is positive or negative, she will either be more inclined to spare or kill her brother respectively in her final encounter. With persuasion, or if she is romanced, the Bhaalspawn may convince her to make the opposite decision, however, if her faith leans heavily (6+) in either direction, she will make her decision immediately without giving you a chance to persuade her. Bear in mind it is harder to convince Sirene to fall than to do the opposite.

Q: <SPOILER CHARACTER> and his demons are handing me my ass! What gives?
A: This was intended to be a very difficult battle. It's entirely optional and you don't have to go for the encounter if you really can't beat it, but there are a lot of goodies if you succeed. Some tips and useful information that might help:
	- The boss leads with a cheap shot before the fight begins by poisoning your whole party. The spell is essentially a max power Poison spell that also lowers Constitution by 4 if your party members fail the save. Poison immunity and saving throw bonuses will save you from losing the fight before it begins.
	- A random demon (glabrezu, balor or death knight) will spawn from the rift every five rounds so long as the fight continues, so it's in your best interest to end the fight as quickly as possible before you are overwhelmed by sheer numbers. To abuse this advantage, the boss will cast Time Stop a lot not only to obliterate you with magic, but also to stall for more demons to spawn.
	- Figure out what your highest priority should be. Defeating the boss will end the battle immediately, but allowing the demons to maul you for free in the meantime may not be the best idea. However, due to the demon-spawning rift, stalling will only get you killed unless you can wipe out the existing demons quickly.
	- The boss will use a 'sequencer' when he reaches Near Death for the first time, which instantly casts Heal, Stoneskin and Mislead on himself, so avoid blowing everything on round one.
	- Summons are very helpful in this fight, despite their tendency to get gibbed. Any means of distracting the demons while you wear down the boss will ultimately make your life easier.
	- If the rift is giving you trouble, try fighting away from it. It won't stop the demons from spawning, but at least they won't chase after you.
	- To avoid breaking continuity Sirene is scripted to auto-resurrect once the boss is defeated if she dies.
	- If Sirene has proficiency points in bastard swords, or if any other Lawful Good party member does, there is a weapon in the area which may be effective in this battle.
	- Protection from Evil is a lifesaver.

Q: I romanced Sirene and she committed suicide to prevent Bodhi from turning her. Bringing her to the Temple Ruins doesn't restore her. Help!
A: Read the item description for her body.
A2: Go to the Temple of Ilmater and let the rest take care of itself.

Q: I killed <SPOILER CHARACTER> and Sirene turned Chaotic Good. Will she be able to regain her paladinhood?
A: Nope. She chose her path and she's going to have to stick with it. Bear in mind this is not meant to be a 'wrong' decision by any means and there are rewards exclusive to this path.

Q: Okay... does she at least get compensation for losing her paladin abilities?
A: Yes. After one in-game day, she'll inform you that since she's no longer bound by her oaths, she will regain use of her tiefling innate powers: Burning Hands, Blur and Blindness (with a chance for berserk). She'll gain more uses of these abilities as she levels up. There are also a couple of unique items on <SPOILER CHARACTER>'s body that you can only claim upon his death, one of which is extremely powerful and Sirene-exclusive. Oh, by the way, if she stayed Lawful Good after the encounter, she'll get one new innate power instead.

Q: Can the Celestial Fire sword be upgraded?
A: Yes, in ToB.

Q: Can you be more specific?
A: The Celestial Fire can be upgraded for 15,000 gp and the Eye of the Celestial (found in Watcher's Keep).
