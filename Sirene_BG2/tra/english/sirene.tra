@100001 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and attempting to steal from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Sirene. However, Sirene knew what would happen and ended her life to prevent Bodhi from corrupting her. Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi stole Sirene's body and warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@100002 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I defeated Bodhi, it seems that she has succeeded in exacting one final revenge on me by taking away Sirene forever... whatever Sirene was forced to do in order to protect herself from being turned has also rendered any means of restoring her to life ineffective. I have no power to do anything, but perhaps her fellow worshippers of Ilmater may be able to help.~
@100003 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Despite my fears, Ilmater has chosen to show his favor by mercifully granting Sirene life anew and freeing her from the Fugue Plane so that she may return to my side. Sirene seems shaken by her experience with death... but seems none the worse for wear.~
